### Abstract
The manufacturing industry faces increasing pressure to minimize its environmental impact while maintaining economic viability. This repository presents a user-friendly procedure to support the selection of appropriate sustainability indicators. The procedure is supported with an indicator catalog consisting of 477 environmental and economic sustainability indicators and comprehensive selection guidelines. The methodology addresses three key challenges: enabling comprehensive and balanced assessment of economic and environmental dimensions, providing broad applicability across diverse use cases, and offering a user-friendly selection process.

## Resources
### 1. Sustainability Indicator Selection Tool (Excel)
The spreadsheet-based selection tool implements the developed four-step procedure and provides:
- Comprehensive indicator catalog: 477 structured environmental and economic sustainability indicators (see Sheet "3b. Full List")
- Use case-specific filtering: Filter indicators by hierarchical level, industry type, company size, and process type (see Sheet "1. & 2. Start")
- Guided selection process: Step-by-step procedure from structuring to balanced indicator set selection (see Sheets 1 to 6)
- Coverage assessment: Visual dashboard to ensure balanced coverage across sustainability dimensions (see Sheet "5.Review")

**Features:**
- Applicability attributes (identifier, name, definition, measurement type, unit of measurement, references)
- Relevance attributes (hierarchical level, industry type, company size, process type, usage frequency (count of references), GRI alignment)
- Coverage attributes (sustainability dimensions and organizational categories)
- Scientific references to indicator catalogues
